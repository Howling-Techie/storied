## Chapter 2: Political Turmoil

Debate ensues within the royal court about what to do with the relic. The kingdom is divided as advisors and members of the royal family voice their opinions, each believing their way is the best path forward.

### Scene 1: The Royal Court Debates

King Sharkon and his advisors debate the implications of the relic. Advisor Finley argues for using its power to expand the kingdom's influence, while Princess Sharla advocates for caution, fearing unknown consequences. The debate grows heated as different factions within the court take sides.

The grand hall of the Royal Palace buzzed with tension as the royal court assembled. Advisors, nobles, and influential members of the kingdom took their seats, each eager to voice their opinions. King Sharkon, seated on his throne, called the meeting to order. "We are here to decide the fate of the relic," he announced, his voice firm. "Speak your minds freely, for this decision will shape the future of our kingdom."

Advisor Finley was the first to rise. "Your Majesty," he began, "the relic holds immense power. With it, we could dominate the seas, expanding our influence and securing our place as the greatest kingdom beneath the waves. Imagine the prosperity and security we could achieve." His words were met with nods of agreement from a faction of the court, eager for power and expansion.

Princess Sharla stood next, her voice clear and resolute. "Father, while Advisor Finley's vision is compelling, we must not rush into this decision. The relic's power is unknown, and with great power comes great risk. We must study it thoroughly, understand its origins and potential consequences before we consider using it." Her caution resonated with those who feared the unknown, garnering support from a more conservative faction within the court.

As the debate continued, voices grew louder, and tempers flared. Some advisors suggested using the relic as a bargaining chip with neighboring kingdoms, while others proposed hiding it away to prevent any potential catastrophe. King Sharkon listened intently, weighing each argument carefully. He could see the wisdom in both Finley's ambition and Sharla's caution, and he knew that a hasty decision could lead to disaster. The fate of the relic, and the future of the kingdom, hung in the balance as the debate raged on.

The debate extended into the night, with no clear consensus in sight. King Sharkon called for a recess, allowing the court to cool their heads and reflect on the arguments presented. In the quiet of his chambers, the king pondered the relic's significance and the heavy burden of leadership. He knew that whatever decision he made, it would define his legacy and the destiny of the shark-folk kingdom. As dawn approached, he resolved to seek the counsel of both his advisors and the kingdom's ancient scholars, hoping to find a path that would ensure the safety and prosperity of his people.
